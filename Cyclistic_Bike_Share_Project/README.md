# Cyclistic Case Study â€“ Bike Share Usage Analysis

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes **5.5 million rides** from Chicagoâ€™s Cyclistic bike-share program (Sept 2024 â€“ Aug 2025).  
Using **SQL Server** for cleaning and analysis and **Tableau Public** for visualization, I compared usage patterns between **annual members** and **casual riders**.  
Key insights show that **members dominate weekday commuting**, while **casual riders take longer leisure rides on weekends**.  
Based on these findings, I recommend **targeted marketing campaigns** to convert casual riders into members, especially during peak summer months and leveraging the popularity of **electric bikes**.


## 1. Business Task
Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, wants to maximize revenue growth by converting more **casual riders** into **annual members**.  
**Key question:** *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*

## 5. Data Dictionary (Shell)
Updated as datasets were ingested.  

| File Name                  | Rows   | Columns | Key Columns            | Notes                                |
|-----------------------------|--------|---------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 2024-09-divvy-tripdata.csv  | ~800k  | 13      | ride_id, member_casual | Includes Aug 31, 2024 anomaly noted  |
| 2024-10-divvy-tripdata.csv  | ~600k  | 13      | ride_id, member_casual |                                      |

## 6. Planned Transformations
- `ride_length = ended_at - started_at`  
- `day_of_week = DATENAME(WEEKDAY, started_at)`  
- `month = FORMAT(started_at, 'yyyy-MM')`  
- `hour_of_day = DATEPART(HOUR, started_at)`  

---

## 7. Data-Quality Rules
- Remove rides with `ride_length <= 0`  
- Remove extreme outliers (`ride_length > 24 hours`)  
- Ensure `started_at < ended_at`  
- Exclude missing values in key fields (ride_id, started_at, ended_at)  
- Document anomalies: missing station names, August 2024 partial data  

---

## 8. Target Metrics (Members vs Casuals)
- Total rides (overall + by user type)  
- Average ride length   
- Ride frequency by month  
- Ride frequency by day of week  
- Ride frequency by hour of day  
- Bike type usage split (classic / electric / scooter)  

---

## 9. Planned Visuals
- **Pie chart** â€“ member vs casual split  
- **Bar chart** â€“ monthly trends  
- **Bar chart** â€“ day of week usage  
- **Line chart** â€“ hourly ride patterns  
- **Stacked bar chart** â€“ bike type breakdown  

---

## 10. Key Results
- **Membership split**: Members ~63%, Casuals ~36%  
- **Ride duration**: Members ~11 min vs Casuals ~19 min  
- **Ride frequency by day**: Members dominate weekdays; Casuals peak on weekends  
- **Seasonality**: Summer (Junâ€“Aug) highest, Winter lowest  
- **Bike type**: Electric bikes most popular for both groups  
- **Hourly usage**:  
  - Members â†’ sharp peaks at 8AM & 5PM (commuting)  
  - Casuals â†’ gradual increase from 8AM to 5PM
